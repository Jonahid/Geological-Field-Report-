# Geological Summary of Rangamati Area

The Rangamati area, located in the southeastern part of Bangladesh, lies within the central portion of the eastern folded belt. The topography is characterized by irregular hillocks trending NNW-SSE and is densely vegetated.

## Tectonic Activity and Geological Features

The Sitapahar anticline is a result of folding and tectonic activity during the collision of the Indian plate with the Burmese plate in the upper Tertiary period. This asymmetrical anticline trends generally NNW-SSE and exhibits a plunging nature, with a steeper western flank and gentler eastern flank resulting from east-west compression due to relative plate motion. Numerous faults and joints, indicative of high tectonic disturbance, are observed throughout the area.

## Field Observations and Rock Units

Fieldwork along the Rangamati-Chittagong Road cut section reveals various rock units with distinct characteristics. The stratigraphic succession is primarily based on lithologic interpretation, with numerous micro faults and different types of joints observed. Most joints are normal to bedding, and faults are identified on both the western and eastern flanks of the road cut section.

## Composition and Geological Significance

Sitapahar anticline comprises sedimentary rocks, predominantly sandstone, shale, sandy shale, and their various alternations. The exposed Neogene succession indicates a basinward progradation from deep marine through shallow marine to continental-fluvial environments.

## Economic Importance and Tourism

The geological and economic significance of the area is considerable, with potential implications for national economic development. Additionally, the region holds promise for tourism, offering opportunities for exploration and appreciation of its geological features. Concretions and hard sandstone are locally utilized as construction materials.
